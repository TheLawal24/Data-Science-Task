Project Title: ML Applications Comparison - Text Classification vs Text Generation
Overview:
This project aim at compareing machine learning applications developed using Text Classification models against those using Text Generation models. The analysis includes generating Top- 20 "Text Classification and Text Generation, a manual input (source code sizes) for a selected number of apps, results analysis and other useful analysis.
Analysis Results:
There are more ML apps for Text Generation models.
Mean Text Classification Spaces: 33.95
Mean Text Generation Spaces: 167.95
Median Text Classification Spaces: 14.5
Median Text Generation Spaces: 78.0
Standard Deviation Text Classification Spaces: 49.74
Standard Deviation Text Generation Spaces: 289.77
Total Text Classification Spaces: 679
Total Text Generation Spaces: 3359

Confirm or Reject "Easier to develop ML application using Text Classification models than applications using Text Generation models" Claim:

Though, my analysis supports the claim that there are more ML applications for Text Generation models. However, ease of development cannot be conclusively determined based on source code size alone. other factors like Complexity of Model Training, Iteration Speed and model optimization, etc.

Design Choices and Assumptions:
The source code size was manually inputted due to the absence of information on the number of source files for each app. i made assumptions regarding the range of the number of apps (minimum of 5, maximum of 20).
The analysis used mean, median, and standard deviation to provide insights into the distribution of source code sizes.
Results indicate variations in source code sizes, suggesting diverse complexities among different ML applications.

Future work may involve obtaining more "accurate" data, incorporating additional metrics for model evaluation, and exploring the impact of source code size on model training and deployment.

Conclusion:
The task/project provides a preliminary comparison between "Text Classification and Text Generation" ML applications based on source code size. Further analysis and considerations are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the development complexities associated with each model type.

NB: i explored variety means to generate my Top - 20 models. i explore the usage of API generated from huggingface.co . 
i got generated my API through documentation and explored https://huggingface.co/spaces/enzostvs/hub-api-playground where i generated my parameters.
also, i adopted web scrapping while i ws facing little diccifulty in generating some datas. i understand the rule of infridgement of a third party of a domain. however, it was arewarding experience.

also, my started excellenttly while my most challending part was sourcing for "Source Code". i eventually manually computated it was so tasking and draining.

Thank you, Dr. Bram
